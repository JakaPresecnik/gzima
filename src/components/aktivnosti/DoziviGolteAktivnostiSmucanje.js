When you reach to the top, you are only a few steps away from the ski slopes, therefore there is no need to carry the heavy ski equipment. The length of the cable car is 3,265 meters, making it the longest cable car in Slovenia. The weight of one carrying cable is 45 tons and the diameter of the cable is 56 mm."
