With a sufficiently large surface, the snowshoes prevent our foot from penetrating the snow. Snowshoeing is also an excellent cardio exercise, because it is highly intense and less burdensome to our joints than most other winter sports are. For this reason, snowshoeing is suitable also for the elderly, and it can also cheer up the children. Its characteristics are most similar to cross-country skiing and Nordic walking."
